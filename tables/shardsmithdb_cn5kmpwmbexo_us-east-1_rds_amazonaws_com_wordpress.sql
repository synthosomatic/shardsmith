The cawing of razor-sharp beaks, and the <em>whoosh</em> of iridescent feathers.\r\n\r\nTo be called a Sentinel, to be counted among those fearless warriors.. conveying generations of honor and courage in service to the High Priestess and the Sisterhood of Elune.\r\n\r\nIt was the only thing that kept her up at night, and the only thing that raced through her thoughts during the day. Each morning she awoke to attend martial arts training with her father, and each evening she poured through tome and scroll, soaking in all she could about the ancient guardian order.\r\n\r\nEirys Windwalker had only been to the Capital once before, when she was almost young enough not to remember. Uncle Gil had brought her and her sister on a pilgrimage, with the intention of allowing them to apprentice for the Sisterhood. Only Rhoslyn remained behind, as was their father\'s compromise. If Sarthoran had it his way, both girls would carry on the family name and the trappings that came with it. Alas, Eirys was the only one to display any combat prowess, and so it was that her sister remained in Darnassus to study under the priestesses of the Sisterhood.\r\n\r\nThe glittering, forestal city left its impression on young Eirys, however, leaving her with an insatiable longing to leave the comforting boughs of Aldrassil and take up arms in defense of the nation and those within it. Her moonlit eyes practically glittered with wonder, watching those vaunted Sentinels scour the skies for any threat, ready to pounce with blade and talon. It saddened her to have to return home to Shadowglen, knowing her father would never approve of these flights of fancy. She had her duty to her family name, after all. She had come of age, she would be a Windwalker, proud and true. Or so Sarthoran always tried to impress upon her.\r\n\r\nAnd so her days were spent distracting herself from her inherited legacy.\r\n\r\nOne such day started innocently enough. The sun\'s gentle rays peeking through the curtain of her treetop loft slowly roused her from her slumber. With a groan and a languid stretch, she shuffled reluctantly out from under the blankets and into a too-large grey cotton shirt. On her way over to the armoire to complete the ensemble, she caught her own reflection in the mirror. Her chin-length alabaster tresses were an absolute rats\' nest, and the dark circles under her eyes coupled with an icy complexion gave her a haunting aura. She stuck her tongue out at herself in defiance as she rummaged through the drawers for acceptably unstained slacks, slid into them, and slipped into a pair of sloppily-laced work boots on her way into the main hall.\r\n\r\nHer housemate, Gareth, gave her a nod from his seated position at the table, his own bright blue shoulder-length mane tied back in a haphazard half-ponytail. She couldn\'t help but notice his normally vibrant fuschia cheeks flushed with the effort of cooking all morning, and she wondered how long he had been up. He hadn\'t been with her long, yet, they had grown fairly close as friends. Only a few months had passed since he arrived from Starbreeze village to begin his druidic studies. Sarthoran agreed to house him on the condition that he keep the lodge clean and cook meals for them for the duration of his stay. Eirys immediately took a liking to him and his cooking, much to her father\'s chagrin.\r\n\r\nThis morning, he had been especially generous with portions. The modest wooden dinner table overflowed with stoneware of varying shapes and sizes. Bowls of plump, piping hot sweetrice. A basket of freshly-laid owls\' eggs. Thick-cut smoked boar, well-marbled and still sizzling. Lip-puckeringly sour kimchi sprinkled with yellow pepper flakes and doused in a nose-tickling scarlet sauce. The pitcher of just-brewed mulled peach tea perched on the table\'s closest edge tempted her the most, and as her eyes glazed over, he let out a soft chuckle and motioned towards it.\r\n\r\nShe wordlessly thanked him as she plopped down the table, reached for a mug and filled it to the brim.\r\n\r\n\"Eiry..\", he mused, as he cracked an egg over his own steaming bowl of sweetrice. \"Have you thought about what they\'ll mark you with once you pass your trial?\"\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a moment, rubbing the pad of her thumb across the grain of the wooden mug, taking in the comforting aroma of coriander, clove and peach pit. She brought the cup to her lips, letting the soothing tonic slip down her throat, warming her belly.\r\n\r\n\"Ahh, I\'m not sure.\", she signed, content. \"I may go with the same as my sister. The twin blades.\" She nodded, as if to affirm the thought with herself. Rhoslyn had chosen, in a violent crimson, jagged lines down both of her eyes, as a nod to her role as protector of the faith and her family ties. \"In purple, I think. I\'ve always liked purple.\" She let herself smile ever so slightly as her gaze lingered on Gareth.\r\n\r\nHe nodded back with a satisfied \"Hm.\" and vigorously stirred his egg-smothered rice with a pair of chopsticks.\r\n\r\nThey both sat in shared content for a moment until Sarthoran\'s large, muscled frame entered the lodge. His booming voice carried especially well inside the hollowed-out tree they called home.\r\n\r\n\"Eirys, girl, hurry up and finish your breakfast. We\'ve a long day ahead of us to make up for yesterday\'s debacle.\" His wild evergreen eyebrows, pulled taut, gave her no quarter.\r\n\r\nShe sighed, defeated, and grabbed a hunk of boar bacon to munch on as Sarthoran took his place at the table. He had secured his equally-wild forest of hair back in a braid this time. He usually kept it up in an elaborate bun reminiscent of the Pandaren samurai she\'d read about as a child. She\'d forgotten just how long it had become: it now reached almost past his waist. Almost as long as Mother\'s was before she..\r\n\r\nEirys swallowed the last thought with a mouthful of bacon and washed it down with tea.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast was over, Sarthoran nodded curtly and let himself out. Eirys followed him dejectedly, looking over her shoulder to Gareth and giving him a small wave. Gareth gestured after her as he set about cleaning up the table.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'One Big Happy Family', '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2018-01-30 14:01:39', '2018-01-30 14:01:39', '', 0, 'http://blog.zenakrua.com/?p=23', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The sun\'s gentle rays peeking through the curtain of her treetop loft slowly roused her from her slumber. With a groan and a languid stretch, she shuffled reluctantly out from under the blankets and into a too-large grey cotton shirt. On her way over to the armoire to complete the ensemble, she caught her own reflection in the mirror. Her chin-length alabaster tresses were an absolute rats\' nest, and the dark circles under her soft moonlit eyes coupled with an icy complexion gave her a haunting aura. She stuck her tongue out at herself in defiance as she rummaged through the drawers for an acceptably unstained pair of slacks and slipped them on, also slipping into a pair of sloppily-laced work boots on her way into the main hall.\r\n\r\nHer housemate, Gavius, gave her a nod from his seated position at the table, his own stark violet shoulder-length mane tied back in a haphazard half-ponytail. She couldn\'t help but notice his normally rose-pink skin flushed with the effort of cooking all morning, and she wondered how long he had been up. He hadn\'t been with her long, yet, they had grown fairly close as friends. Only a few months had passed since he arrived from Starbreeze village to begin his druidic studies. Xeriah immediately took a liking to him, much to her father\'s chagrin. Sarthoran agreed to house him on the condition that he keep the lodge clean and cook meals for them for the duration of his stay.\r\n\r\nThis morning, he had been especially generous with portions. The modest wooden dinner table overflowed with stoneware of varying shapes and sizes. Plump, piping hot sweetrice and fresh, raw owls\' eggs. Thick-cut smoked boar, well marbled and sizzling. Lip-puckeringly sour kimchi sprinkled with yellow pepper flakes and doused in a nose-tickling bright red sauce. The pitcher of just-brewed mulled peach tea perched on the table\'s closest edge tempted her the most, and as her eyes glittered with joy, he let out a soft chuckle and motioned towards it.\r\n\r\nShe wordlessly thanked him as she sat at the table, reached for a mug and filled it to the brim.\r\n\r\n\"Xer..\", he mused, as he cracked an egg over his own steaming bowl of sweetrice. \"Have you thought about what they\'ll mark you with once you pass your trial?\"\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a moment, rubbing the pad of her thumb across the grain of the wooden mug, and taking in the comforting aroma of coriander, clove and peach essence. She brought the cup to her lips, letting the soothing tonic slip down her throat, warming her belly.\r\n\r\n\"Ahh, I\'m not sure.\", she signed, content. \"I may go with the same as my sister. The twin blades.\" She nodded, as if to affirm the thought with herself. Sioranda had chosen the twin blades, in a violent crimson, as a nod both to her role as protector of the faith, and to her family ties. \"In purple, I think. I\'ve always liked purple.\" She let herself smile ever so slightly as her gaze lingered on Gavius.\r\n\r\nHe nodded back with a satisfied \"Hm.\" and vigorously stirred his egg-smothered rice with a pair of chopsticks.', 'The Balance of Nature', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-08-18 18:01:49', '2017-08-18 18:01:49', '', 23, 'http://blog.zenakrua.com/index.php/2017/08/18/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
